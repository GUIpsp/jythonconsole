==========================
Known problems
==========================

You must use the keyboard not the mouse to select methods.  (Due to focus problems.)

Builtin types don't work like they do in PyCrust.  This is because they have a null __doc__ string in Jython.

Method popup gets abandoned with too many backspaces.  (Use <ESC> to make it go away)

History doesn't quite work correctly

python.security.respectJavaAccessibility must be set to true in Jython's registry (is this still true?)

--

You can't insert '(' and ')' in the middle of a line [ FIXED r8 ]

Method popup displays names multiple times for overloaded methods [ FIXED r9 Harry Fuecks ]

Static methods and properties don't seem to work correctly. [ FIXED r10, r11, r16 ]

<CTRL>+D (or <CRTL>+Z) to exit is not implemented [ FIXED r16 ]
